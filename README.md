# Railway Oriented Programming - The Kotlin Kata!

This kata is based on the awesome talk by Scott Wlaschin 

The talk shows how techniques found in functional programming, allow your code to explain it's logic clearly, without having to litter it with error handling and try/catches.

To watch the talk, follow the links on this page:

This Kata gets you to:
* implement the data types for "one track" and "two track" railway programming.
* implement the functions Scott uses in ther

## Where do I start?

1. Clone the repo

2. Open the project in your IDE (I assume you have Kotlin installed)

3. Navigate to src/test/OptionTests.kt

## Why have I made this Kata?

Functional programming can seem daunting. The field of study is massive, so I wanted to introduce some of the concepts with some simple examples and code.
